<h1>Terrell Eugene Diggs Jr Web Developer</h1>
<p>Started my journey to become a web developer 2020 after my small trucking fleet and logistics business failed. The pain
  alone ispired me to pursue my child hood dream an venture off into tech and my first love of play with games and computers.
  computers. At some point i even hope to develop an app along with building my skill and learning new technologies 
  to become an Web developer and also develop software and learn how to work along side other developers on diferent projects.
  This is a very big decision chhosing to change careers but im folowing my insticts and my desire to be creative

<p>Learing new a skill and working fulltime has been one of the biggest challenges of my life so far. There are so many
  technolgies along with programming languages to learn but you can only take on one at a time. The most satifying feeeling 
  is when you begin to learn and perfect a new skill like learning HTML and CSS and start to notice youur getting better by 
  the day.

<p>My short term goal is to learn HTML,CSS, and Javascript to the best of my abilty and learn to get creaive and 
  create eye appealing websites. I want to ge very solid at applyig the basics first before i worry about taking on 
  big projects that are out of my scope. Patients will pay off. I asire to land a position as a jr web developer 
  at some point when i get a few personal projecs unde my belt. While im in the process i will put effort into joinng 
  communites filled with other people on the same journey as me. Software Engineer is my goal and learning Python amongst 
  othe language is on m gol list, but i feel like tackling HTML,CSS, and Javascript will give me a chance to jump right
  in and write some code and see some results and get that dopamine flowing
